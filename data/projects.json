        "description": "A Line Follower Robot is an autonomous vehicle that detect and follows a black or white path using Infrared (IR) sensors. The sensors, typically composed of IR LEDs and photodiodes, measure surface reflectivity to distinguish the line from the floor. A microcontroller processes this data and controls the motor driver to adjust wheel speed/direction, ensuring accurate path tracking.",
